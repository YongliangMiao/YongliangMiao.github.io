I'm a fourth-year AI student at Hong Kong Baptist University. I am currently waiting for admission results for a Master's in Computer Science and interning in [Pair City](https://www.paircity.com/home) while conducting research on LLM uncertainty. You can find my [CV](assets/Resume_YongliangMiao.pdf) here.

üî•<span style="color: #BF360C; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.1em;">If you need a research intern who is self-motivated and responsible, I‚Äôd be a great fit!</span>üî•
