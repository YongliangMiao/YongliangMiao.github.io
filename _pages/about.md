I'm a fourth-year AI student at [Beijing Normal-Hong Kong Baptist University](https://uic.edu.cn/en/). I am currently waiting for admission results for a Master's in Computer Science and interning in [Pair City](https://www.paircity.com/home) while conducting research on LLM uncertainty.

🔥<span style="color: #BF360C; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.1em;">If you need a research intern who is self-motivated and responsible, I’d be a great fit!</span>🔥
